# 3D-Printed Chairlift Controlled by Raspberry Pi

## Overview

This project involves designing, 3D printing, and building a chairlift model. The chairlift is controlled using a Raspberry Pi, and a web interface allows for remote operation and monitoring. This project was completed as a final project for CS121.

## Features

- **3D-Printed Design**: The chairlift model is designed and 3D printed, showcasing a realistic and functional design.
- **Raspberry Pi Control**: Utilizes a Raspberry Pi to control the movement and operation of the chairlift.
- **Web Interface**: A website interface allows users to remotely control and monitor the chairlift.

## Technologies Used

- **3D Printing**: For designing and creating the physical model of the chairlift.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Used for controlling the chairlift's motor and sensors.
- **Python**: For scripting the control logic on the Raspberry Pi.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating the web interface to control the chairlift.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework used to create the web server on the Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

- **Start/Stop Chairlift**: Use the web interface to start and stop the chairlift.
- **Monitor Status**: View real-time status updates of the chairlift, including speed and position.
- **Adjust Settings**: Modify settings such as speed and direction from the web interface.

## Project Structure

- **3DModels/**: Contains the STL files for 3D printing the chairlift parts.
- **static/**: Contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript for the web interface.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML templates for the web interface.
- **app.py**: Main Flask application file.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies for the project.
